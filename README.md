# Panda3D BAM Exporter

This is a Blender plugin to export models to the `.bam` format, which can be loaded
into the <a href="https://github.com/panda3d/panda3d" target="_blank">Panda3D</a> engine.

It provides several advantages over <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/09th/YABEE">YABEE</a> (which
is an exporter for the `.egg` format), mainly speed and smaller exported files.


### Installation

Just click `Download ZIP`, and install that zip from the Blender user preferences.


### Usage

After you installed the plugin, you should have an entry `File > Export > Panda3D (.bam)`.
You can also use the quick search, press `space` and then type `bam`.

If you click that entry, a standard exporter window will open, with several options
in the lower left. 

**TODO:** Write wiki entry about export options.
